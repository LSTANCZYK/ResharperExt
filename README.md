ResharperExt
============

Some Resharper Macros and Extensions.

For the moment we have only two macros that you may use in your templates.

1. Capitalize a referenced variable.
2. Capitalize a referenced variable and insert a low dash "_" before all referenced variable's capital chars.
3. Current file name without any extension.
4. Another variable's value in singular.
